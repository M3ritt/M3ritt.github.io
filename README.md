# M3ritt.github.io

<a href = "https://m3ritt.github.io" target = "_blank">This</a> is a small portfolio I made to brag a little about the experiences and work that I have seen as my time as a programmer throughout college and my work. 

The website is broken up into a few sections that include:
<ul>
  <li> Title, current position, and my top skills due to my current job. </li>
  <li> My most developed skills, whether through my job, school or personal learning. </li>
  <li> A portfolio of the projects I thought were the most impressive or that I enjoyed the most (with links to the code!). </li>
  <li> An "About Me" section talking about a few of my experiences. </li>
  <li> A "Contact Me" section. </li>
</ul>

Thank you for taking the time to take a look!
